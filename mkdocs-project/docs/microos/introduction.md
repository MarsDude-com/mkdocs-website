**2024-12-02 :** Today I took a dive into the not-well-known and installed an immutable linux distro as my daily driver: [OpenSUSE MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/) (Kalpa).

For a couple of months I had the Pop!_OS 24.04 beta (the one with the Cosmic DE alpha). It was stable as a rock and I really REALLY think that Cosmic is the best Desktop Environment. It has real tiling out of the box. No extensions, not the thing that KDE Plasma calls tiling (which in reality is an advanced window snapping feature, not tiling). So no problem right???

Right! But... My curiosity has a tendency to be uncontrollable. I have been reading articles and watching videos about immutable distros and dabbled a bit with some in a VM. And that usually results in: installing, tweaking some stuff and remembering I had that VM after about a month.

No better way to get to know something new, than to use it every day. And today was that day. IÇ˜e installed the Kalpa version. OpenSUSE has started renaming stuff to confuse people some more. So MicroOS Desktop Gnome and MicroOS Desktop KDE Plasma are now called Aeon and Kalpa. And to confuse things even more: at this moment (2024-12-02), Kalpa (in alpha) can be installed with the MicroOS iso, and Aeon (in beta) has become its own thing and is offered seperately. But not as an iso... sigh. I'm sure there is some logic. 

So far, I'm liking it. I'm intrigued. I got it installed, installed some flatpaks, created a Tumbleweed container with distrobox and added a second entry in my applications for Konsole (the terminal in Plasma) and named it 'Konsole TW', which, when started, opens up inside the container. Maybe that might be a little first howto? [Let me know](Contact).

This section of my brand new site will be dedicated to my journey with MicroOS. I'll do some updates like this one, and some tutorial/howto pages on getting things the way you want to (which could be accompanied by a long list of how to NOT get it to work the way you wanted it to).

So, here we are.
